<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AbbarhSF/DdosToolKit/main/images%20(19).jpeg">

A Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack is a non-intrusive internet attack made to take down the targeted website or slow it down by flooding the network, server or application with fake traffic. When against a vulnerable resource-intensive endpoint, even a tiny amount of traffic is enough for the attack to succeed.
